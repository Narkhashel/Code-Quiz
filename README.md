# Twilight Imperium Game Quiz Challenge

## Description 

This weekâ€™s challenge is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code I wrote. The User story is asking us for a JavaScript-related quiz, but I would love to, through this experience, introduce you to my favorite board game - Twilight Imperium 4th edition. Hope you will have fun!

### Acceptance Criteria

Given I am taking a code quiz:
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and score
